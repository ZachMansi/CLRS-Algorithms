Personal important notes from the chapter

There are many computational problems but have 2 characteristics

1. There are many solutions the majority don't solve the problem. Finding the best one can be quite difficult
2. Many practical applications Shortest

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Largest computational constraints

1. Time
2. Speed
Efficient algorithms help utilize both wisely
