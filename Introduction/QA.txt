Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A manager trying to figure our who is the strongest of his workers to maximize efficiency for a job.
A leader finding the smallest perimeter of his citizens houses for police planning

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1-2
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality of output, cost

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List:
Pro - 
Easily itterable
Easily implemented
Supports objects
Flexible retrival

Con - 
Needs to be looped to find specific values
Not efficient

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1-4
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

similar -
want to find the shortest distance
There are constraints that make the problem more complex

different - 
The salesman returns back to the original point
The salesman has multiple destinations not one

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1-5
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best: Worker moving 100 boxes from one end of a building to another
Aprox: Pronouncing letters

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2-1
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filtering a list as part of a search feature
Algo needs to find a specific character in a list of characters in a list of strings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2-2
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n2 steps, while merge
sort runs in 64n lg n steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge
sort?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

n = 43

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2-3
What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n2
runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2n on the same machine?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

n = 15
